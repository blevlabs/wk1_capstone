# Week 1 Capstone Project

This is a BeaverWorks CogWorks Capstone Project\
(I made the repo I get to decide the asterisk)

This is the Week 1 Project, which involves classification of songs based on a predetermined set of waveforms and user input. This will function similar to the "spotify" software with our own algorithmic implementation.
